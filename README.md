### Main Discussion

Project is made using standard javascript language and several modules are installed in it, if the script is already in your local storage follow these steps (Assume that [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is already installed on your computer) :

```
npm install
```

then run 

```
react-native run-android
```
